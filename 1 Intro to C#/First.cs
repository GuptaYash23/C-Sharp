/*

This C# code is a simple program that prints a message to the console. Let's break it down line by line:

using System;: This line includes the System namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used types, such as Console. By including this namespace, you can use its classes without needing to specify the full namespace path.

public class HelloWorld: This line defines a public class named HelloWorld. In C#, every program must have at least one class. The public keyword means that this class can be accessed from other classes.

public static void Main(string[] args): This line defines the Main method, which is the entry point of any C# console application.

public: The method can be accessed from other classes.

static: This means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. You can call it without creating an object of the class.

void: This indicates that the method does not return any value.

string[] args: This parameter is an array of strings that can hold command-line arguments passed to the program when it is executed.

{ and }: These curly braces define the beginning and end of the class and method bodies.

Console.WriteLine("Hello World");: This line is the statement that actually performs the action of the program. It calls the WriteLine method of the Console class to print the string "Hello World" to the console.
