/* Stream Writer Class

StreamWriter class can be used to write text files.

StreamWriter class in C# writes characters to a stream in a specified encoding.

StreamWriter.Write() method is responsible for writing text to a stream.

StreamWriter class is inherited from TextWrite class that provides methods to write an object to a string, write strings to a file, or to serializa XML.

We can write any kind of datatype in the file but eventually file stores the data in the string format.
