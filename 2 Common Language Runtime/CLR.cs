/* Common Language Runtime (CLR)

CLR stands for Common Language Runtime. It is a core component of the .NET framework and serves as the execution engine for .NET applications, including those written in C#. Here are some key points about CLR:

1. Execution Environment: CLR provides a managed execution environment for .NET applications. It handles the execution of code, memory management, and other system services.

2. Memory Management: CLR includes a garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. This helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

3. Type Safety: CLR enforces type safety, ensuring that code adheres to the defined data types. This helps catch errors at runtime and improves the reliability of applications.

4. Interoperability: CLR allows for interoperability between different programming languages. This means that code written in one .NET language (like C#) can interact with code written in another .NET language (like VB.NET or F#).

5. Security: CLR provides a security model that includes code access security (CAS) and role-based security. This helps protect applications from unauthorized access and malicious code.

6. Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT): When a .NET application is executed, the CLR uses a process called Just-In-Time compilation to convert the Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code. This allows the application to run on the specific hardware and operating system.

7. Exception Handling: CLR provides a structured way to handle exceptions, allowing developers to write robust error-handling code.

In summary, the Common Language Runtime is a crucial part of the .NET framework that provides a managed environment for executing applications, handling memory, ensuring security, and enabling interoperability among different programming languages.
